Visualization and Processing of observations from the VELC 5303 Å Channel

The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard India’s Aditya-L1 mission provides spectroscopic observations of the solar corona in the Fe XIV 5303 Å green line, a key diagnostic of coronal plasma. While Level-1 data products are publicly available, optimal scientific use requires careful calibration and correction of instrumental signatures.

This tutorial introduces participants to handling VELC Level-1 spectroscopic data from the 5303 Å channel. The session will demonstrate:

Reading and visualizing VELC Level-1 FITS data
Understanding detector characteristics specific to the VELC sCMOS system
Dark subtraction 
Removal of sCMOS readout pattern artifacts
Wavelength calibration of the spectrograph data
Correction for spectral curvature across the slit
Generation of spectral maps 

The tutorial is designed as a hands-on guide for early users of Aditya-L1/VELC data, enabling participants to analyze Level-1 observations. 

Requirement: Qt5 (for visualization tools and interactive routines)

Data: Data can be downloaded from ISRO's PRADAN portal. For this tutorial, data can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/hz6l1hnblfw1d2qxjv4ec/AG6UUYhjG3E5q1RWNxtGcXg?rlkey=riwhrph0nib9ferkx98meorl4&st=7hn5s3un&dl=0
